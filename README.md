# MINI PROJECT IDEAS
Projects are an integral part of learning. Watching one tutorial after the other will not make you a good web developer. Escape from the **tutorial hell**.After watching each topic from the above resources, try to create a project of your own. Got stuck? Google it out! Want help? Use stack overflow! But donot just blindly follow a tutorial and think that you have mastered web development. Get your hands dirty in code.

# 1. Landing Page

# 4. Calculator
